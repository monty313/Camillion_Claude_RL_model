# UPDATE LOG (IRAC)

Every change appends a dated IRAC entry. **Conclusion** states why it helps the bot
pass FTMO-style challenges more consistently.

## [2026-06-21] Phase 0 — bare-bones framework initialized
- **I (Issue):** Need a fresh, modular RL framework where strategies are alphas the
  agent learns to combine, with a fixed observation that never breaks when strategies
  are added, plus FTMO logic carried over from Quantra.
- **R (Rule):** Build spec (Camillion Phase 0) + Quantra FTMO numbers (2.5% / 4% /
  two-phase) + Monty's corrections (SMA p1–p4 shifts; CCI/RSI raw+shifted) + hybrid
  observation (raw indicators **and** alphas).
- **A (Application):** Frozen contract (357 float32) in `constants.py`; indicator
  registry (190); 64-slot `StrategyRegistry` + occupancy mask; signal summary/memory/
  accuracy (no leakage); account/risk scaffolds; observation builder; 28 tests (all
  passing); importable Jarvis + Barbershop stubs; 7 docs.
- **C (Conclusion):** A locked, scale-stable observation lets one policy keep training
  as the alpha library grows — the prerequisite for repeatedly passing FTMO.

## [2026-06-21] Risk knobs made runtime-editable (no retrain)
- **I:** Monty must change target / trailing-DD / trailing on-off in BOTH modes
  without retraining.
- **R:** Operator note + the percentage-feature design.
- **A:** Moved FTMO target/trailing/toggle into `variables.py`; `ftmo_config.py`
  builds configs from them; added `update_risk_settings(...)` live mutator; account
  features divide by the active config's (editable) limits.
- **C:** One trained model is reusable across many challenge configurations → far
  faster iteration toward a stable pass rate.
